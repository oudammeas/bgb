### BGB

BGB is a web application that allow board game players to create and join game rooms. BGB brings all trading transaction in trading games online so now players can manage their moneys when they play games such as Monoploy from their personal devices. I get inspiration for the UI from `Kahoot.it`.

This is a web application written in Javascript using: 
- Frontend:    `created-react-app`, `bootstrap ` , `reactstrap`
- Backend : `express`, `socket.io`
- Database: `mongobd`
